         <p><big>Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
            The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and perception.
            AI is being used across different industries including finance and healthcare.
            Weak AI tends to be simple and single-task oriented, while strong AI carries on tasks that are more complex and human-like.
            Understanding Artificial Intelligence (AI)
            When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots. That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.
